# Regression-Analysis

Linear Regression marks the first step in predictive modelling.. No doubt, it’s fairly easy to implement. . But, merely running just one line of code, doesn’t solve the purpose. Neither just looking at R² or MSE values. Regression tells much more than that!

For model improvement, you also need to understand regression assumptions and ways to fix them when they get violated.
In this repositry, I’ve explained the important regression assumptions and plots (with fixes and solutions) to help you understand the regression concept in further detail.
